{"id":"karigor-od6","title":"Pre-Implementation: Backup current state","description":"**Context**: Creating a backup tag provides a safety net for quick rollback if critical issues are discovered during implementation.\n\n**Objective**: Create an immutable Git tag marking the pre-rebrand state for emergency rollback capability.\n\n**Approach**:\n1. Ensure working tree is clean: git status\n2. Verify on correct commit: git log -1 --oneline\n3.
