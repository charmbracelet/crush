{"id":"karigor-od6","title":"Pre-Implementation: Backup current state","description":"**Context**: Creating a backup tag provides a safety net for quick rollback if critical issues are discovered during implementation.\n\n**Objective**: Create an immutable Git tag marking the pre-rebrand state for emergency rollback capability.\n\n**Approach**:\n1. Ensure working tree is clean: git status\n2. Verify on correct commit: git log -1 --oneline\n3. Create annotated tag: git tag -a backup-pre-karigor -m 'Backup before Karigor rebrand - DO NOT DELETE'\n4. Verify tag created: git tag -l backup-pre-karigor\n5. Show tag details: git show backup-pre-karigor\n6. Optional: Push tag to remote for team backup: git push origin backup-pre-karigor\n\n**Why This Approach**:\n- Provides instant rollback point (git reset --hard backup-pre-karigor)\n- Creates immutable reference to working state\n- Annotated tag includes metadata (author, date, message)\n- Pushed tag serves as team safety net\n- Prevents accidental loss if branch is corrupted\n\n**Acceptance Criteria**:\n✓ Tag 'backup-pre-karigor' exists locally\n✓ Tag is annotated (not lightweight)\n✓ Tag message includes clear warning\n✓ Tag points to current HEAD commit\n✓ Working tree is clean (no uncommitted changes)\n✓ Optional: Tag pushed to origin for team access\n\n**Validation**:\ngit tag -l | grep backup-pre-karigor\ngit show backup-pre-karigor | head -20\n\n**Expected Output**:\ntag backup-pre-karigor\nTagger: [your name] \u003c[your email]\u003e\nDate: [current date]\nBackup before Karigor rebrand - DO NOT DELETE\n\n**Rollback Command** (if needed later):\ngit reset --hard backup-pre-karigor","status":"open","priority":0,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-18T09:18:21.716933602+06:00","updated_at":"2025-12-18T09:26:15.332194112+06:00"}
