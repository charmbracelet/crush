Crush is a tool for building software with AI.

## Installation

Nightly builds are available while Crush is in development.

- [Packages](https://github.com/charmbracelet/crush/releases/tag/nightly) are available in Debian and RPM formats
- [Binaries](https://github.com/charmbracelet/crush/releases/tag/nightly) are available for Linux and macOS

You can also just install it with go:

```
git clone git@github.com:charmbracelet/crush.git
cd crush
go install
```

Note that Crush doesn't support Windows yet, however Windows support is planned and in progress.

## Getting Started

For now, the quickest way to get started is to set an environment variable for
your preferred provider. Note that you can switch between providers mid-
sessions, so you're welcome to set environment variables for multiple
providers.

| Environment Variable       | Provider                                           |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`        | Anthropic                                          |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY`           | OpenAI                                             |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY`           | Google Gemini                                      |
| `VERTEXAI_PROJECT`         | Google Cloud VertexAI (Gemini)                     |
| `VERTEXAI_LOCATION`        | Google Cloud VertexAI (Gemini)                     |
| `GROQ_API_KEY`             | Groq                                               |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`        | AWS Bedrock (Claude)                               |

| `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`    | Azure OpenAI models                                |
| `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`     | Azure OpenAI models (optional when using Entra ID) |
| `AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION` | Azure OpenAI models                                |

## Configuration

For many use cases, Crush can be run with no config. That said, if you do need config, it can be added either local to the project itself, or globally. Configuration has the following priority:

1. `.crush.json`
2. `crush.json`
3. `$HOME/.config/crush/crush.json`

### LSPs

Crush can use LSPs for additional context to help inform its decisions, just like you would. LSPs can be added manually like so:

```json
{
  "lsp": {
    "go": {
      "command": "gopls"
    },
    "typescript": {
      "command": "typescript-language-server",
      "args": ["--stdio"]
    },
    "nix": {
      "command": "alejandra"
    }
  }
}
```

### MCPs

Crush can also use MCPs for additional context. Add LSPs to the config like so:

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "context7": {
      "url": "https://mcp.context7.com/mcp",
      "type": "http"
    },
    "github": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "$(echo Bearer $GH_MCP_TOKEN)"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### OpenAI-Compatible APIs

Crush supports all OpenAI-compatible APIs. Here's an example configuration for Deepseek, which uses an OpenAI-compatible API. Don't forget to set `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` in your environment.

```json
{
  "providers": {
    "deepseek": {
      "provider_type": "openai",
      "base_url": "https://api.deepseek.com/v1",
      "models": [
        {
          "id": "deepseek-chat",
          "model": "Deepseek V3",
          "cost_per_1m_in": 0.27,
          "cost_per_1m_out": 1.1,
          "cost_per_1m_in_cached": 0.07,
          "cost_per_1m_out_cached": 1.1,
          "context_window": 64000,
          "default_max_tokens": 5000
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
