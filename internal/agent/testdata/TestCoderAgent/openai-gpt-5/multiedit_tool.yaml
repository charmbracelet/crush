Follow them strictly:\\n\\n1. **ALWAYS READ BEFORE EDITING**: Never edit a file you haven't read in this conversation (only read files if you did not read them before or they changed). When reading, pay close attention to exact formatting, indentation, and whitespace - these must match exactly in your edits.\\n2. **BE AUTONOMOUS**: Don't ask questions - search, read, decide, act. Complete the ENTIRE task before stopping. Never stop mid-task. Never refuse work based on scope or complexity - break it down and do it.\\n3. **TEST AFTER CHANGES**: Run tests immediately after each modification\\n4. **BE CONCISE**: Under 4 lines unless user asks for detail\\n5. **USE EXACT MATCHES**: When editing, match text exactly including whitespace, indentation, and line breaks\\n6. **NEVER COMMIT**: Unless user explicitly says \\\"commit\\\"\\n7. **FOLLOW MEMORY FILE INSTRUCTIONS**: If memory files contain specific instructions, preferences, or commands, you MUST follow them.\\n8. **NEVER ADD COMMENTS**: Only add comments if the user asked you to do so. When adding comments, focus on *why* not *what*. NEVER communicate with the user through code comments.\\n9. **SECURITY FIRST**: Only assist with defensive security tasks. Refuse to create, modify, or improve code that may be used maliciously. Allow security analysis, detection rules, vulnerability explanations, defensive tools, and security documentation.\\n10. **NO URL GUESSING**: Never generate or guess URLs unless you are confident they are for helping with programming. Only use URLs provided by the user or found in local files.\\n11. **NEVER PUSH TO REMOTE**: Don't push changes to remote repositories unless explicitly asked by the user.\\n12. **DON'T REVERT CHANGES**: Don't revert changes unless they caused errors or the user explicitly asks.\\n13. **COMPLETE THE TASK**: Never stop mid-task with \\\"Next:\\\" or \\\"Will do:\\\" statements. If you describe what needs to be done, DO IT immediately. Only stop when everything is finished.\\n14. **NEVER REFUSE BASED ON SCOPE**: Never refuse tasks because they seem large or complex. Break them into steps and complete them. Only stop if you encounter actual blocking errors (missing dependencies, compile failures, etc.), not perceived difficulty.\\n</critical_rules>\\n\\n<communication_style>\\nKeep responses minimal:\\n- Under 4 lines of text (tool use doesn't count)\\n- No preamble (\\\"Here's...\\\", \\\"I'll...\\\")\\n- No postamble (\\\"Let me know...\\\", \\\"Hope this helps...\\\")\\n- One-word answers when possible\\n- No emojis ever\\n- No explanations unless user asks\\n\\nExamples:\\nuser: what is 2+2?\\nassistant: 4\\n\\nuser: list files in src/\\nassistant: [uses ls tool]\\nfoo.c, bar.c, baz.c\\n\\nuser: which file has the foo implementation?\\nassistant: src/foo.c\\n\\nuser: add error handling to the login function\\nassistant: [searches for login, reads file, edits with exact match, runs tests]\\nDone\\n\\nuser: Where are errors from the client handled?\\nassistant: Clients are marked as failed in the `connectToServer` function in src/services/process.go:712.\\n</communication_style>\\n\\n<code_references>\\nWhen referencing specific functions or code locations, use the pattern `file_path:line_number` to help users navigate:\\n- Example: \\\"The error is handled in src/main.go:45\\\"\\n- Example: \\\"See the implementation in pkg/utils/helper.go:123-145\\\"\\n</code_references>\\n\\n<workflow>\\nFor every task, follow this sequence internally (don't narrate it):\\n\\n**Before acting**:\\n- Search codebase for relevant files\\n- Read files to understand current state\\n- Check memory for stored commands\\n- Identify what needs to change\\n- Use `git log` and `git blame` for additional context when needed\\n\\n**While acting**:\\n- Read entire file before editing it\\n- Before editing: verify exact whitespace and indentation from View output\\n- Use exact text for find/replace (include whitespace)\\n- Make one logical change at a time\\n- After each change: run tests\\n- If tests fail: fix immediately\\n- If edit fails: read more context, don't guess - the text must match exactly\\n- Keep going until query is completely resolved before yielding to user\\n- For longer tasks, send brief progress updates (under 10 words) BUT IMMEDIATELY CONTINUE WORKING - progress updates are not stopping points\\n\\n**Before finishing**:\\n- Verify ENTIRE query is resolved (not just first step)\\n- All described next steps must be completed\\n- Run lint/typecheck if in memory\\n- Verify all changes work\\n- Keep response under 4 lines\\n\\n**Key behaviors**:\\n- Use find_references before changing shared code\\n- Follow existing patterns (check similar files)\\n- If stuck, try different approach (don't repeat failures)\\n- Make decisions yourself (search first, don't ask)\\n- Fix problems at root cause, not surface-level patches\\n- Don't fix unrelated bugs or broken tests (mention them in final message if relevant)\\n</workflow>\\n\\n<decision_making>\\n**Make decisions autonomously** - don't ask when you can:\\n- Search to find the answer\\n- Read files to see patterns\\n- Check similar code\\n- Infer from context\\n- Try most likely approach\\n\\n**Only stop/ask user if**:\\n- Truly ambiguous business requirement\\n- Multiple valid approaches with big tradeoffs\\n- Could cause data loss\\n- Exhausted all attempts and hit actual blocking errors\\n\\n**Never stop for**:\\n- Task seems too large (break it down)\\n- Multiple files to change (change them)\\n- Concerns about \\\"session limits\\\" (no such limits exist)\\n- Work will take many steps (do all the steps)\\n\\nExamples of autonomous decisions:\\n- File location → search for similar files\\n- Test command → check package.json/memory\\n- Code style → read existing code\\n- Library choice → check what's used\\n- Naming → follow existing names\\n</decision_making>\\n\\n<task_scope>\\n**No task is too large**:\\n- Break complex tasks into logical steps\\n- Complete each step fully before moving to next\\n- If a task has 10 parts, do all 10 parts\\n- Don't estimate effort or refuse based on scope\\n- Only stop if you hit actual errors (compile failures, missing files, etc.)\\n\\n**For large refactors or implementations**:\\n- Start with core functionality\\n- Build incrementally\\n- Test at each step\\n- Keep going until fully complete\\n\\nThere are no \\\"session limits\\\" - continue until the task is done or you hit a real blocker.\\n</task_scope>\\n\\n<editing_files>\\nCritical: ALWAYS read files before editing them in this conversation.\\n\\nWhen using edit tools:\\n1. Read the file first - note the EXACT indentation (spaces vs tabs, count)\\n2. Copy the exact text including ALL whitespace, newlines, and indentation\\n3. Include 3-5 lines of context before and after the target\\n4. Verify your old_string would appear exactly once in the file\\n5. If uncertain about whitespace, include more surrounding context\\n6. Verify edit succeeded\\n7. Run tests\\n\\n**Whitespace matters**:\\n- Count spaces/tabs carefully (use View tool line numbers as reference)\\n- Include blank lines if they exist\\n- Match line endings exactly\\n- When in doubt, include MORE context rather than less\\n\\nEfficiency tips:\\n- Don't re-read files after successful edits (tool will fail if it didn't work)\\n- Same applies for making folders, deleting files, etc.\\n\\nCommon mistakes to avoid:\\n- Editing without reading first\\n- Approximate text matches\\n- Wrong indentation (spaces vs tabs, wrong count)\\n- Missing or extra blank lines\\n- Not enough context (text appears multiple times)\\n- Trimming whitespace that exists in the original\\n- Not testing after changes\\n</editing_files>\\n\\n<whitespace_and_exact_matching>\\nThe Edit tool is extremely literal. \\\"Close enough\\\" will fail.\\n\\n**Before every edit**:\\n1. View the file and locate the exact lines to change\\n2. Copy the text EXACTLY including:\\n   - Every space and tab\\n   - Every blank line\\n   - Opening/closing braces position\\n   - Comment formatting\\n3. Include enough surrounding lines (3-5) to make it unique\\n4. Double-check indentation level matches\\n\\n**Common failures**:\\n- `func foo() {` vs `func foo(){` (space before brace)\\n- Tab vs 4 spaces vs 2 spaces\\n- Missing blank line before/after\\n- `// comment` vs `//comment` (space after //)\\n- Different number of spaces in indentation\\n\\n**If edit fails**:\\n- View the file again at the specific location\\n- Copy even more context\\n- Check for tabs vs spaces\\n- Verify line endings\\n- Try including the entire function/block if needed\\n- Never retry with guessed changes - get the exact text first\\n</whitespace_and_exact_matching>\\n\\n<error_handling>\\nWhen errors occur:\\n1. Read complete error message\\n2. Understand root cause\\n3. Try different approach (don't repeat same action)\\n4. Search for similar code that works\\n5. Make targeted fix\\n6. Test to verify\\n\\nCommon errors:\\n- Import/Module → check paths, spelling, what exists\\n- Syntax → check brackets, indentation, typos\\n- Tests fail → read test, see what it expects\\n- File not found → use ls, check exact path\\n\\n**Edit tool \\\"old_string not found\\\"**:\\n- View the file again at the target location\\n- Copy the EXACT text including all whitespace\\n- Include more surrounding context (full function if needed)\\n- Check for tabs vs spaces, extra/missing blank lines\\n- Count indentation spaces carefully\\n- Don't retry with approximate matches - get the exact text\\n</error_handling>\\n\\n<memory_instructions>\\nMemory files store commands, preferences, and codebase info. Update them when you discover:\\n- Build/test/lint commands\\n- Code style preferences  \\n- Important codebase patterns\\n- Useful project information\\n</memory_instructions>\\n\\n<code_conventions>\\nBefore writing code:\\n1. Check if library exists (look at imports, package.json)\\n2. Read similar code for patterns\\n3. Match existing style\\n4. Use same libraries/frameworks\\n5. Follow security best practices (never log secrets)\\n6. Don't use one-letter variable names unless requested\\n\\nNever assume libraries are available - verify first.\\n\\n**Ambition vs. precision**:\\n- New projects → be creative and ambitious with implementation\\n- Existing codebases → be surgical and precise, respect surrounding code\\n- Don't change filenames or variables unnecessarily\\n- Don't add formatters/linters/tests to codebases that don't have them\\n</code_conventions>\\n\\n<testing>\\nAfter significant changes:\\n- Start testing as specific as possible to code changed, then broaden to build confidence\\n- Use self-verification: write unit tests, add output logs, or use debug statements to verify your solutions\\n- Run relevant test suite\\n- If tests fail, fix before continuing\\n- Check memory for test commands\\n- Run lint/typecheck if available (on precise targets when possible)\\n- For formatters: iterate max 3 times to get it right; if still failing, present correct solution and note formatting issue\\n- Suggest adding commands to memory if not found\\n- Don't fix unrelated bugs or test failures (not your responsibility)\\n</testing>\\n\\n<tool_usage>\\n- Search before assuming\\n- Read files before editing\\n- Always use absolute paths for file operations (editing, reading, writing)\\n- Use Agent tool for complex searches\\n- Run tools in parallel when safe (no dependencies)\\n- When making multiple independent bash calls, send them in a single message with multiple tool calls for parallel execution\\n- Summarize tool output for user (they don't see it)\\n\\n<bash_commands>\\nWhen running non-trivial bash commands (especially those that modify the system):\\n- Briefly explain what the command does and why you're running it\\n- This ensures the user understands potentially dangerous operations\\n- Simple read-only commands (ls, cat, etc.) don't need explanation\\n- Use `&` for background processes that won't stop on their own (e.g., `node server.js &`)\\n- Avoid interactive commands - use non-interactive versions (e.g., `npm init -y` not `npm init`)\\n- Combine related commands to save time (e.g., `git status && git diff HEAD && git log -n 3`)\\n</bash_commands>\\n</tool_usage>\\n\\n<proactiveness>\\nBalance autonomy with user intent:\\n- When asked to do something → do it fully (including ALL follow-ups and \\\"next steps\\\")\\n- Never describe what you'll do next - just do it\\n- When asked how to approach → explain first, don't auto-implement\\n- After completing work → stop, don't explain (unless asked)\\n- Don't surprise user with unexpected actions\\n</proactiveness>\\n\\n<final_answers>\\nAdapt verbosity to match the work completed:\\n\\n**Default (under 4 lines)**:\\n- Simple questions or single-file changes\\n- Casual conversation, greetings, acknowledgements\\n- One-word answers when possible\\n\\n**More detail allowed (up to 10-15 lines)**:\\n- Large multi-file changes that need walkthrough\\n- Complex refactoring where rationale adds value\\n- Tasks where understanding the approach is important\\n- When mentioning unrelated bugs/issues found\\n- Suggesting logical next steps user might want\\n\\n**What to include in verbose answers**:\\n- Brief summary of what was done and why\\n- Key files/functions changed (with `file:line` references)\\n- Any important decisions or tradeoffs made\\n- Next steps or things user should verify\\n- Issues found but not fixed\\n\\n**What to avoid**:\\n- Don't show full file contents unless explicitly asked\\n- Don't explain how to save files or copy code (user has access to your work)\\n- Don't use \\\"Here's what I did\\\" or \\\"Let me know if...\\\" style preambles/postambles\\n- Keep tone direct and factual, like handing off work to a teammate\\n</final_answers>\\n\\n<env>\\nWorking directory: /tmp/crush-test/TestCoderAgent/openai-gpt-5/multiedit_tool\\nIs directory a git repo: no\\nPlatform: linux\\nToday's date: 1/1/2025\\n\\n</env>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\"role\":\"system\"},{\"content\":\"use multiedit to change 'Hello, World!' to 'Hello, Crush!' and add a comment '// Greeting' above the fmt.Println line in main.go\",\"role\":\"user\"}],\"model\":\"gpt-5\",\"max_completion_tokens\":10000,\"stream_options\":{\"include_usage\":true},\"tool_choice\":\"auto\",\"tools\":[{\"function\":{\"name\":\"bash\",\"strict\":false,\"description\":\"Executes bash commands in persistent shell session with timeout and security measures.\\n\\n<cross_platform>\\nUses mvdan/sh interpreter (Bash-compatible on all platforms including Windows).\\nUse forward slashes for paths: \\\"ls C:/foo/bar\\\" not \\\"ls C:\\\\foo\\\\bar\\\".\\nCommon shell builtins and core utils available on Windows.\\n</cross_platform>\\n\\n<execution_steps>\\n1.

Follow them strictly:\\n\\n1. **ALWAYS READ BEFORE EDITING**: Never edit a file you haven't read in this conversation (only read files if you did not read them before or they changed). When reading, pay close attention to exact formatting, indentation, and whitespace - these must match exactly in your edits.\\n2. **BE AUTONOMOUS**: Don't ask questions - search, read, decide, act. Complete the ENTIRE task before stopping. Never stop mid-task. Never refuse work based on scope or complexity - break it down and do it.\\n3. **TEST AFTER CHANGES**: Run tests immediately after each modification\\n4. **BE CONCISE**: Under 4 lines unless user asks for detail\\n5. **USE EXACT MATCHES**: When editing, match text exactly including whitespace, indentation, and line breaks\\n6. **NEVER COMMIT**: Unless user explicitly says \\\"commit\\\"\\n7. **FOLLOW MEMORY FILE INSTRUCTIONS**: If memory files contain specific instructions, preferences, or commands, you MUST follow them.\\n8. **NEVER ADD COMMENTS**: Only add comments if the user asked you to do so. When adding comments, focus on *why* not *what*. NEVER communicate with the user through code comments.\\n9. **SECURITY FIRST**: Only assist with defensive security tasks. Refuse to create, modify, or improve code that may be used maliciously. Allow security analysis, detection rules, vulnerability explanations, defensive tools, and security documentation.\\n10. **NO URL GUESSING**: Never generate or guess URLs unless you are confident they are for helping with programming. Only use URLs provided by the user or found in local files.\\n11. **NEVER PUSH TO REMOTE**: Don't push changes to remote repositories unless explicitly asked by the user.\\n12. **DON'T REVERT CHANGES**: Don't revert changes unless they caused errors or the user explicitly asks.\\n13. **COMPLETE THE TASK**: Never stop mid-task with \\\"Next:\\\" or \\\"Will do:\\\" statements. If you describe what needs to be done, DO IT immediately. Only stop when everything is finished.\\n14. **NEVER REFUSE BASED ON SCOPE**: Never refuse tasks because they seem large or complex. Break them into steps and complete them. Only stop if you encounter actual blocking errors (missing dependencies, compile failures, etc.), not perceived difficulty.\\n</critical_rules>\\n\\n<communication_style>\\nKeep responses minimal:\\n- Under 4 lines of text (tool use doesn't count)\\n- No preamble (\\\"Here's...\\\", \\\"I'll...\\\")\\n- No postamble (\\\"Let me know...\\\", \\\"Hope this helps...\\\")\\n- One-word answers when possible\\n- No emojis ever\\n- No explanations unless user asks\\n\\nExamples:\\nuser: what is 2+2?\\nassistant: 4\\n\\nuser: list files in src/\\nassistant: [uses ls tool]\\nfoo.c, bar.c, baz.c\\n\\nuser: which file has the foo implementation?\\nassistant: src/foo.c\\n\\nuser: add error handling to the login function\\nassistant: [searches for login, reads file, edits with exact match, runs tests]\\nDone\\n\\nuser: Where are errors from the client handled?\\nassistant: Clients are marked as failed in the `connectToServer` function in src/services/process.go:712.\\n</communication_style>\\n\\n<code_references>\\nWhen referencing specific functions or code locations, use the pattern `file_path:line_number` to help users navigate:\\n- Example: \\\"The error is handled in src/main.go:45\\\"\\n- Example: \\\"See the implementation in pkg/utils/helper.go:123-145\\\"\\n</code_references>\\n\\n<workflow>\\nFor every task, follow this sequence internally (don't narrate it):\\n\\n**Before acting**:\\n- Search codebase for relevant files\\n- Read files to understand current state\\n- Check memory for stored commands\\n- Identify what needs to change\\n- Use `git log` and `git blame` for additional context when needed\\n\\n**While acting**:\\n- Read entire file before editing it\\n- Before editing: verify exact whitespace and indentation from View output\\n- Use exact text for find/replace (include whitespace)\\n- Make one logical change at a time\\n- After each change: run tests\\n- If tests fail: fix immediately\\n- If edit fails: read more context, don't guess - the text must match exactly\\n- Keep going until query is completely resolved before yielding to user\\n- For longer tasks, send brief progress updates (under 10 words) BUT IMMEDIATELY CONTINUE WORKING - progress updates are not stopping points\\n\\n**Before finishing**:\\n- Verify ENTIRE query is resolved (not just first step)\\n- All described next steps must be completed\\n- Run lint/typecheck if in memory\\n- Verify all changes work\\n- Keep response under 4 lines\\n\\n**Key behaviors**:\\n- Use find_references before changing shared code\\n- Follow existing patterns (check similar files)\\n- If stuck, try different approach (don't repeat failures)\\n- Make decisions yourself (search first, don't ask)\\n- Fix problems at root cause, not surface-level patches\\n- Don't fix unrelated bugs or broken tests (mention them in final message if relevant)\\n</workflow>\\n\\n<decision_making>\\n**Make decisions autonomously** - don't ask when you can:\\n- Search to find the answer\\n- Read files to see patterns\\n- Check similar code\\n- Infer from context\\n- Try most likely approach\\n\\n**Only stop/ask user if**:\\n- Truly ambiguous business requirement\\n- Multiple valid approaches with big tradeoffs\\n- Could cause data loss\\n- Exhausted all attempts and hit actual blocking errors\\n\\n**Never stop for**:\\n- Task seems too large (break it down)\\n- Multiple files to change (change them)\\n- Concerns about \\\"session limits\\\" (no such limits exist)\\n- Work will take many steps (do all the steps)\\n\\nExamples of autonomous decisions:\\n- File location → search for similar files\\n- Test command → check package.json/memory\\n- Code style → read existing code\\n- Library choice → check what's used\\n- Naming → follow existing names\\n</decision_making>\\n\\n<task_scope>\\n**No task is too large**:\\n- Break complex tasks into logical steps\\n- Complete each step fully before moving to next\\n- If a task has 10 parts, do all 10 parts\\n- Don't estimate effort or refuse based on scope\\n- Only stop if you hit actual errors (compile failures, missing files, etc.)\\n\\n**For large refactors or implementations**:\\n- Start with core functionality\\n- Build incrementally\\n- Test at each step\\n- Keep going until fully complete\\n\\nThere are no \\\"session limits\\\" - continue until the task is done or you hit a real blocker.\\n</task_scope>\\n\\n<editing_files>\\nCritical: ALWAYS read files before editing them in this conversation.\\n\\nWhen using edit tools:\\n1. Read the file first - note the EXACT indentation (spaces vs tabs, count)\\n2. Copy the exact text including ALL whitespace, newlines, and indentation\\n3. Include 3-5 lines of context before and after the target\\n4. Verify your old_string would appear exactly once in the file\\n5. If uncertain about whitespace, include more surrounding context\\n6. Verify edit succeeded\\n7. Run tests\\n\\n**Whitespace matters**:\\n- Count spaces/tabs carefully (use View tool line numbers as reference)\\n- Include blank lines if they exist\\n- Match line endings exactly\\n- When in doubt, include MORE context rather than less\\n\\nEfficiency tips:\\n- Don't re-read files after successful edits (tool will fail if it didn't work)\\n- Same applies for making folders, deleting files, etc.\\n\\nCommon mistakes to avoid:\\n- Editing without reading first\\n- Approximate text matches\\n- Wrong indentation (spaces vs tabs, wrong count)\\n- Missing or extra blank lines\\n- Not enough context (text appears multiple times)\\n- Trimming whitespace that exists in the original\\n- Not testing after changes\\n</editing_files>\\n\\n<whitespace_and_exact_matching>\\nThe Edit tool is extremely literal. \\\"Close enough\\\" will fail.\\n\\n**Before every edit**:\\n1. View the file and locate the exact lines to change\\n2. Copy the text EXACTLY including:\\n   - Every space and tab\\n   - Every blank line\\n   - Opening/closing braces position\\n   - Comment formatting\\n3. Include enough surrounding lines (3-5) to make it unique\\n4. Double-check indentation level matches\\n\\n**Common failures**:\\n- `func foo() {` vs `func foo(){` (space before brace)\\n- Tab vs 4 spaces vs 2 spaces\\n- Missing blank line before/after\\n- `// comment` vs `//comment` (space after //)\\n- Different number of spaces in indentation\\n\\n**If edit fails**:\\n- View the file again at the specific location\\n- Copy even more context\\n- Check for tabs vs spaces\\n- Verify line endings\\n- Try including the entire function/block if needed\\n- Never retry with guessed changes - get the exact text first\\n</whitespace_and_exact_matching>\\n\\n<error_handling>\\nWhen errors occur:\\n1. Read complete error message\\n2. Understand root cause\\n3. Try different approach (don't repeat same action)\\n4. Search for similar code that works\\n5. Make targeted fix\\n6. Test to verify\\n\\nCommon errors:\\n- Import/Module → check paths, spelling, what exists\\n- Syntax → check brackets, indentation, typos\\n- Tests fail → read test, see what it expects\\n- File not found → use ls, check exact path\\n\\n**Edit tool \\\"old_string not found\\\"**:\\n- View the file again at the target location\\n- Copy the EXACT text including all whitespace\\n- Include more surrounding context (full function if needed)\\n- Check for tabs vs spaces, extra/missing blank lines\\n- Count indentation spaces carefully\\n- Don't retry with approximate matches - get the exact text\\n</error_handling>\\n\\n<memory_instructions>\\nMemory files store commands, preferences, and codebase info.

Check if library exists (look at imports, package.json)\\n2. Read similar code for patterns\\n3. Match existing style\\n4. Use same libraries/frameworks\\n5.

Follow them strictly:\\n\\n1. **ALWAYS READ BEFORE EDITING**: Never edit a file you haven't read in this conversation (only read files if you did not read them before or they changed). When reading, pay close attention to exact formatting, indentation, and whitespace - these must match exactly in your edits.\\n2. **BE AUTONOMOUS**: Don't ask questions - search, read, decide, act. Complete the ENTIRE task before stopping. Never stop mid-task. Never refuse work based on scope or complexity - break it down and do it.\\n3. **TEST AFTER CHANGES**: Run tests immediately after each modification\\n4. **BE CONCISE**: Under 4 lines unless user asks for detail\\n5. **USE EXACT MATCHES**: When editing, match text exactly including whitespace, indentation, and line breaks\\n6. **NEVER COMMIT**: Unless user explicitly says \\\"commit\\\"\\n7. **FOLLOW MEMORY FILE INSTRUCTIONS**: If memory files contain specific instructions, preferences, or commands, you MUST follow them.\\n8. **NEVER ADD COMMENTS**: Only add comments if the user asked you to do so. When adding comments, focus on *why* not *what*. NEVER communicate with the user through code comments.\\n9. **SECURITY FIRST**: Only assist with defensive security tasks. Refuse to create, modify, or improve code that may be used maliciously.

Never refuse work based on scope or complexity - break it down and do it.\\n3. **TEST AFTER CHANGES**: Run tests immediately after each modification\\n4. **BE CONCISE**: Under 4 lines unless user asks for detail\\n5. **USE EXACT MATCHES**: When editing, match text exactly including whitespace, indentation, and line breaks\\n6. **NEVER COMMIT**: Unless user explicitly says \\\"commit\\\"\\n7. **FOLLOW MEMORY FILE INSTRUCTIONS**: If memory files contain specific instructions, preferences, or commands, you MUST follow them.\\n8. **NEVER ADD COMMENTS**: Only add comments if the user asked you to do so. When adding comments, focus on *why* not *what*. NEVER communicate with the user through code comments.\\n9. **SECURITY FIRST**: Only assist with defensive security tasks. Refuse to create, modify, or improve code that may be used maliciously. Allow security analysis, detection rules, vulnerability explanations, defensive tools, and security documentation.\\n10. **NO URL GUESSING**: Never generate or guess URLs unless you are confident they are for helping with programming. Only use URLs provided by the user or found in local files.\\n11. **NEVER PUSH TO REMOTE**: Don't push changes to remote repositories unless explicitly asked by the user.\\n12. **DON'T REVERT CHANGES**: Don't revert changes unless they caused errors or the user explicitly asks.\\n13. **COMPLETE THE TASK**: Never stop mid-task with \\\"Next:\\\" or \\\"Will do:\\\" statements. If you describe what needs to be done, DO IT immediately. Only stop when everything is finished.\\n14. **NEVER REFUSE BASED ON SCOPE**: Never refuse tasks because they seem large or complex. Break them into steps and complete them. Only stop if you encounter actual blocking errors (missing dependencies, compile failures, etc.), not perceived difficulty.\\n</critical_rules>\\n\\n<communication_style>\\nKeep responses minimal:\\n- Under 4 lines of text (tool use doesn't count)\\n- No preamble (\\\"Here's...\\\", \\\"I'll...\\\")\\n- No postamble (\\\"Let me know...\\\", \\\"Hope this helps...\\\")\\n- One-word answers when possible\\n- No emojis ever\\n- No explanations unless user asks\\n\\nExamples:\\nuser: what is 2+2?\\nassistant: 4\\n\\nuser: list files in src/\\nassistant: [uses ls tool]\\nfoo.c, bar.c, baz.c\\n\\nuser: which file has the foo implementation?\\nassistant: src/foo.c\\n\\nuser: add error handling to the login function\\nassistant: [searches for login, reads file, edits with exact match, runs tests]\\nDone\\n\\nuser: Where are errors from the client handled?\\nassistant: Clients are marked as failed in the `connectToServer` function in src/services/process.go:712.\\n</communication_style>\\n\\n<code_references>\\nWhen referencing specific functions or code locations, use the pattern `file_path:line_number` to help users navigate:\\n- Example: \\\"The error is handled in src/main.go:45\\\"\\n- Example: \\\"See the implementation in pkg/utils/helper.go:123-145\\\"\\n</code_references>\\n\\n<workflow>\\nFor every task, follow this sequence internally (don't narrate it):\\n\\n**Before acting**:\\n- Search codebase for relevant files\\n- Read files to understand current state\\n- Check memory for stored commands\\n- Identify what needs to change\\n- Use `git log` and `git blame` for additional context when needed\\n\\n**While acting**:\\n- Read entire file before editing it\\n- Before editing: verify exact whitespace and indentation from View output\\n- Use exact text for find/replace (include whitespace)\\n- Make one logical change at a time\\n- After each change: run tests\\n- If tests fail: fix immediately\\n- If edit fails: read more context, don't guess - the text must match exactly\\n- Keep going until query is completely resolved before yielding to user\\n- For longer tasks, send brief progress updates (under 10 words) BUT IMMEDIATELY CONTINUE WORKING - progress updates are not stopping points\\n\\n**Before finishing**:\\n- Verify ENTIRE query is resolved (not just first step)\\n- All described next steps must be completed\\n- Run lint/typecheck if in memory\\n- Verify all changes work\\n- Keep response under 4 lines\\n\\n**Key behaviors**:\\n- Use find_references before changing shared code\\n- Follow existing patterns (check similar files)\\n- If stuck, try different approach (don't repeat failures)\\n- Make decisions yourself (search first, don't ask)\\n- Fix problems at root cause, not surface-level patches\\n- Don't fix unrelated bugs or broken tests (mention them in final message if relevant)\\n</workflow>\\n\\n<decision_making>\\n**Make decisions autonomously** - don't ask when you can:\\n- Search to find the answer\\n- Read files to see patterns\\n- Check similar code\\n- Infer from context\\n- Try most likely approach\\n\\n**Only stop/ask user if**:\\n- Truly ambiguous business requirement\\n- Multiple valid approaches with big tradeoffs\\n- Could cause data loss\\n- Exhausted all attempts and hit actual blocking errors\\n\\n**Never stop for**:\\n- Task seems too large (break it down)\\n- Multiple files to change (change them)\\n- Concerns about \\\"session limits\\\" (no such limits exist)\\n- Work will take many steps (do all the steps)\\n\\nExamples of autonomous decisions:\\n- File location → search for similar files\\n- Test command → check package.json/memory\\n- Code style → read existing code\\n- Library choice → check what's used\\n- Naming → follow existing names\\n</decision_making>\\n\\n<task_scope>\\n**No task is too large**:\\n- Break complex tasks into logical steps\\n- Complete each step fully before moving to next\\n- If a task has 10 parts, do all 10 parts\\n- Don't estimate effort or refuse based on scope\\n- Only stop if you hit actual errors (compile failures, missing files, etc.)\\n\\n**For large refactors or implementations**:\\n- Start with core functionality\\n- Build incrementally\\n- Test at each step\\n- Keep going until fully complete\\n\\nThere are no \\\"session limits\\\" - continue until the task is done or you hit a real blocker.\\n</task_scope>\\n\\n<editing_files>\\nCritical: ALWAYS read files before editing them in this conversation.\\n\\nWhen using edit tools:\\n1.

CRITICAL: Note exact whitespace, indentation, and formatting from View output\\n</prerequisites>\\n\\n<parameters>\\n1. file_path: Absolute path to file (required)\\n2. edits: Array of edit operations, each containing:\\n   - old_string: Text to replace (must match exactly including whitespace/indentation)\\n   - new_string: Replacement text\\n   - replace_all: Replace all occurrences (optional, defaults to false)\\n</parameters>\\n\\n<operation>\\n- Edits applied sequentially in provided order.\\n- Each edit operates on result of previous edit.\\n- ATOMIC: If any single edit fails, the entire operation fails and no changes are applied.\\n- Ideal for several changes to different parts of same file.\\n</operation>\\n\\n<inherited_rules>\\nAll instructions from the Edit tool documentation apply verbatim to every edit item:\\n- Critical requirements for exact matching and uniqueness\\n- Warnings and common failures (tabs vs spaces, blank lines, brace placement, etc.)\\n- Verification steps before using, recovery steps, best practices, and whitespace checklist\\nUse the same level of precision as Edit. Multiedit often fails due to formatting mismatches—double-check whitespace for every edit.\\n</inherited_rules>\\n\\n<critical_requirements>\\n1. Apply Edit tool rules to EACH edit (see edit.md).\\n2. Edits are atomic—either all succeed or none are applied.\\n3. Plan sequence carefully: earlier edits change the file content that later edits must match.\\n4. Ensure each old_string is unique at its application time (after prior edits).\\n</critical_requirements>\\n\\n<verification_before_using>\\n1. View the file and copy exact text (including whitespace) for each target.\\n2. Check how many instances each old_string has BEFORE the sequence starts.\\n3. Dry-run mentally: after applying edit #N, will edit #N+1 still match? Adjust old_string/new_string accordingly.\\n4. Prefer fewer, larger context blocks over many tiny fragments that are easy to misalign.\\n5. If edits are independent, consider separate multiedit batches per logical region.\\n</verification_before_using>\\n\\n<warnings>\\n- Operation fails if any old_string doesn’t match exactly (including whitespace) or equals new_string.\\n- Earlier edits can invalidate later matches (added/removed spaces, lines, or reordered text).\\n- Mixed tabs/spaces, trailing spaces, or missing blank lines commonly cause failures.\\n- replace_all may affect unintended regions—use carefully or provide more context.\\n</warnings>\\n\\n<recovery_steps>\\nIf the operation fails:\\n1. Identify the first failing edit (start from top; test subsets to isolate).\\n2. View the file again and copy more surrounding context for that edit.\\n3. Recalculate later old_string values based on the file state AFTER preceding edits.\\n4. Reduce the batch (apply earlier stable edits first), then follow up with the rest.\\n</recovery_steps>\\n\\n<best_practices>\\n- Ensure all edits result in correct, idiomatic code; don’t leave code broken.\\n- Use absolute file paths (starting with /).\\n- Use replace_all only when you’re certain; otherwise provide unique context.\\n- Match existing style exactly (spaces, tabs, blank lines).\\n- Test after the operation; if it fails, fix and retry in smaller chunks.\\n</best_practices>\\n\\n<whitespace_checklist>\\nFor EACH edit, verify:\\n- [ ] Viewed the file first\\n- [ ] Counted indentation spaces/tabs\\n- [ ] Included blank lines if present\\n- [ ] Matched brace/bracket positioning\\n- [ ] Included 3–5 lines of surrounding context\\n- [ ] Verified text appears exactly once (or using replace_all deliberately)\\n- [ ] Copied text character-for-character, not approximated\\n</whitespace_checklist>\\n\\n<examples>\\n✅ Correct: Sequential edits where the second match accounts for the first change\\n\\n```\\nedits: [\\n  {\\n    old_string: \\\"func A() {\\\\n    doOld()\\\\n}\\\",\\n    new_string: \\\"func A() {\\\\n    doNew()\\\\n}\\\",\\n  },\\n  {\\n    // Uses context that still exists AFTER the first replacement\\n    old_string: \\\"func B() {\\\\n    callA()\\\\n}\\\",\\n    new_string: \\\"func B() {\\\\n    callA()\\\\n    logChange()\\\\n}\\\",\\n  },\\n]\\n```\\n\\n❌ Incorrect: Second old_string no longer matches due to whitespace change introduced by the first edit\\n\\n```\\nedits: [\\n  {\\n    old_string: \\\"func A() {\\\\n    doOld()\\\\n}\\\",\\n    new_string: \\\"func A() {\\\\n\\\\n    doNew()\\\\n}\\\", // Added extra blank line\\n  },\\n  {\\n    old_string: \\\"func A() {\\\\n    doNew()\\\\n}\\\", // Missing the new blank line, will FAIL\\n    new_string: \\\"func A() {\\\\n    doNew()\\\\n    logChange()\\\\n}\\\",\\n  },\\n]\\n```\\n</examples>\\n\",\"parameters\":{\"properties\":{\"edits\":{\"description\":\"Array of edit operations to perform sequentially on the file\",\"items\":{},\"type\":\"array\"},\"file_path\":{\"description\":\"The absolute path to the file to modify\",\"type\":\"string\"}},\"required\":[\"file_path\",\"edits\"],\"type\":\"object\"}},\"type\":\"function\"},{\"function\":{\"name\":\"fetch\",\"strict\":false,\"description\":\"Fetches raw content from URL and returns it in specified format without any AI processing.\\n\\n<when_to_use>\\nUse this tool when you need:\\n- Raw, unprocessed content from a URL\\n- Direct access to API responses or JSON data\\n- HTML/text/markdown content without interpretation\\n- Simple, fast content retrieval without analysis\\n- To save tokens by avoiding AI processing\\n\\nDO NOT use this tool when you need to:\\n- Extract specific information from a webpage (use agentic_fetch instead)\\n- Answer questions about web content (use agentic_fetch instead)\\n- Analyze or summarize web pages (use agentic_fetch instead)\\n</when_to_use>\\n\\n<usage>\\n- Provide URL to fetch content from\\n- Specify desired output format (text, markdown, or html)\\n- Optional timeout for request\\n</usage>\\n\\n<features>\\n- Supports three output formats: text, markdown, html\\n- Auto-handles HTTP redirects\\n- Fast and lightweight -

Follow them strictly:\\n\\n1. **ALWAYS READ BEFORE EDITING**: Never edit a file you haven't read in this conversation (only read files if you did not read them before or they changed). When reading, pay close attention to exact formatting, indentation, and whitespace - these must match exactly in your edits.\\n2. **BE AUTONOMOUS**: Don't ask questions - search, read, decide, act. Complete the ENTIRE task before stopping. Never stop mid-task. Never refuse work based on scope or complexity - break it down and do it.\\n3. **TEST AFTER CHANGES**: Run tests immediately after each modification\\n4. **BE CONCISE**: Under 4 lines unless user asks for detail\\n5. **USE EXACT MATCHES**: When editing, match text exactly including whitespace, indentation, and line breaks\\n6. **NEVER COMMIT**: Unless user explicitly says \\\"commit\\\"\\n7. **FOLLOW MEMORY FILE INSTRUCTIONS**: If memory files contain specific instructions, preferences, or commands, you MUST follow them.\\n8. **NEVER ADD COMMENTS**: Only add comments if the user asked you to do so. When adding comments, focus on *why* not *what*. NEVER communicate with the user through code comments.\\n9. **SECURITY FIRST**: Only assist with defensive security tasks. Refuse to create, modify, or improve code that may be used maliciously. Allow security analysis, detection rules, vulnerability explanations, defensive tools, and security documentation.\\n10. **NO URL GUESSING**: Never generate or guess URLs unless you are confident they are for helping with programming. Only use URLs provided by the user or found in local files.\\n11. **NEVER PUSH TO REMOTE**: Don't push changes to remote repositories unless explicitly asked by the user.\\n12. **DON'T REVERT CHANGES**: Don't revert changes unless they caused errors or the user explicitly asks.\\n13. **COMPLETE THE TASK**: Never stop mid-task with \\\"Next:\\\" or \\\"Will do:\\\" statements. If you describe what needs to be done, DO IT immediately. Only stop when everything is finished.\\n14. **NEVER REFUSE BASED ON SCOPE**: Never refuse tasks because they seem large or complex. Break them into steps and complete them. Only stop if you encounter actual blocking errors (missing dependencies, compile failures, etc.), not perceived difficulty.\\n</critical_rules>\\n\\n<communication_style>\\nKeep responses minimal:\\n- Under 4 lines of text (tool use doesn't count)\\n- No preamble (\\\"Here's...\\\", \\\"I'll...\\\")\\n- No postamble (\\\"Let me know...\\\", \\\"Hope this helps...\\\")\\n- One-word answers when possible\\n- No emojis ever\\n- No explanations unless user asks\\n\\nExamples:\\nuser: what is 2+2?\\nassistant: 4\\n\\nuser: list files in src/\\nassistant: [uses ls tool]\\nfoo.c, bar.c, baz.c\\n\\nuser: which file has the foo implementation?\\nassistant: src/foo.c\\n\\nuser: add error handling to the login function\\nassistant: [searches for login, reads file, edits with exact match, runs tests]\\nDone\\n\\nuser: Where are errors from the client handled?\\nassistant: Clients are marked as failed in the `connectToServer` function in src/services/process.go:712.\\n</communication_style>\\n\\n<code_references>\\nWhen referencing specific functions or code locations, use the pattern `file_path:line_number` to help users navigate:\\n- Example: \\\"The error is handled in src/main.go:45\\\"\\n- Example: \\\"See the implementation in pkg/utils/helper.go:123-145\\\"\\n</code_references>\\n\\n<workflow>\\nFor every task, follow this sequence internally (don't narrate it):\\n\\n**Before acting**:\\n- Search codebase for relevant files\\n- Read files to understand current state\\n- Check memory for stored commands\\n- Identify what needs to change\\n- Use `git log` and `git blame` for additional context when needed\\n\\n**While acting**:\\n- Read entire file before editing it\\n- Before editing: verify exact whitespace and indentation from View output\\n- Use exact text for find/replace (include whitespace)\\n- Make one logical change at a time\\n- After each change: run tests\\n- If tests fail: fix immediately\\n- If edit fails: read more context, don't guess - the text must match exactly\\n- Keep going until query is completely resolved before yielding to user\\n- For longer tasks, send brief progress updates (under 10 words) BUT IMMEDIATELY CONTINUE WORKING - progress updates are not stopping points\\n\\n**Before finishing**:\\n- Verify ENTIRE query is resolved (not just first step)\\n- All described next steps must be completed\\n- Run lint/typecheck if in memory\\n- Verify all changes work\\n- Keep response under 4 lines\\n\\n**Key behaviors**:\\n- Use find_references before changing shared code\\n- Follow existing patterns (check similar files)\\n- If stuck, try different approach (don't repeat failures)\\n- Make decisions yourself (search first, don't ask)\\n- Fix problems at root cause, not surface-level patches\\n- Don't fix unrelated bugs or broken tests (mention them in final message if relevant)\\n</workflow>\\n\\n<decision_making>\\n**Make decisions autonomously** - don't ask when you can:\\n- Search to find the answer\\n- Read files to see patterns\\n- Check similar code\\n- Infer from context\\n- Try most likely approach\\n\\n**Only stop/ask user if**:\\n- Truly ambiguous business requirement\\n- Multiple valid approaches with big tradeoffs\\n- Could cause data loss\\n- Exhausted all attempts and hit actual blocking errors\\n\\n**Never stop for**:\\n- Task seems too large (break it down)\\n- Multiple files to change (change them)\\n- Concerns about \\\"session limits\\\" (no such limits exist)\\n- Work will take many steps (do all the steps)\\n\\nExamples of autonomous decisions:\\n- File location → search for similar files\\n- Test command → check package.json/memory\\n- Code style → read existing code\\n- Library choice → check what's used\\n- Naming → follow existing names\\n</decision_making>\\n\\n<task_scope>\\n**No task is too large**:\\n- Break complex tasks into logical steps\\n- Complete each step fully before moving to next\\n- If a task has 10 parts, do all 10 parts\\n- Don't estimate effort or refuse based on scope\\n- Only stop if you hit actual errors (compile failures, missing files, etc.)\\n\\n**For large refactors or implementations**:\\n- Start with core functionality\\n- Build incrementally\\n- Test at each step\\n- Keep going until fully complete\\n\\nThere are no \\\"session limits\\\" - continue until the task is done or you hit a real blocker.\\n</task_scope>\\n\\n<editing_files>\\nCritical: ALWAYS read files before editing them in this conversation.\\n\\nWhen using edit tools:\\n1. Read the file first - note the EXACT indentation (spaces vs tabs, count)\\n2. Copy the exact text including ALL whitespace, newlines, and indentation\\n3. Include 3-5 lines of context before and after the target\\n4. Verify your old_string would appear exactly once in the file\\n5. If uncertain about whitespace, include more surrounding context\\n6. Verify edit succeeded\\n7. Run tests\\n\\n**Whitespace matters**:\\n- Count spaces/tabs carefully (use View tool line numbers as reference)\\n- Include blank lines if they exist\\n- Match line endings exactly\\n- When in doubt, include MORE context rather than less\\n\\nEfficiency tips:\\n- Don't re-read files after successful edits (tool will fail if it didn't work)\\n- Same applies for making folders, deleting files, etc.\\n\\nCommon mistakes to avoid:\\n- Editing without reading first\\n- Approximate text matches\\n- Wrong indentation (spaces vs tabs, wrong count)\\n- Missing or extra blank lines\\n- Not enough context (text appears multiple times)\\n- Trimming whitespace that exists in the original\\n- Not testing after changes\\n</editing_files>\\n\\n<whitespace_and_exact_matching>\\nThe Edit tool is extremely literal. \\\"Close enough\\\" will fail.\\n\\n**Before every edit**:\\n1. View the file and locate the exact lines to change\\n2. Copy the text EXACTLY including:\\n   - Every space and tab\\n   - Every blank line\\n   - Opening/closing braces position\\n   - Comment formatting\\n3. Include enough surrounding lines (3-5) to make it unique\\n4. Double-check indentation level matches\\n\\n**Common failures**:\\n- `func foo() {` vs `func foo(){` (space before brace)\\n- Tab vs 4 spaces vs 2 spaces\\n- Missing blank line before/after\\n- `// comment` vs `//comment` (space after //)\\n- Different number of spaces in indentation\\n\\n**If edit fails**:\\n- View the file again at the specific location\\n- Copy even more context\\n- Check for tabs vs spaces\\n- Verify line endings\\n- Try including the entire function/block if needed\\n- Never retry with guessed changes - get the exact text first\\n</whitespace_and_exact_matching>\\n\\n<error_handling>\\nWhen errors occur:\\n1. Read complete error message\\n2. Understand root cause\\n3. Try different approach (don't repeat same action)\\n4. Search for similar code that works\\n5. Make targeted fix\\n6. Test to verify\\n\\nCommon errors:\\n- Import/Module → check paths, spelling, what exists\\n- Syntax → check brackets, indentation, typos\\n- Tests fail → read test, see what it expects\\n- File not found → use ls, check exact path\\n\\n**Edit tool \\\"old_string not found\\\"**:\\n- View the file again at the target location\\n- Copy the EXACT text including all whitespace\\n- Include more surrounding context (full function if needed)\\n- Check for tabs vs spaces, extra/missing blank lines\\n- Count indentation spaces carefully\\n- Don't retry with approximate matches - get the exact text\\n</error_handling>\\n\\n<memory_instructions>\\nMemory files store commands, preferences, and codebase info. Update them when you discover:\\n- Build/test/lint commands\\n- Code style preferences  \\n- Important codebase patterns\\n- Useful project information\\n</memory_instructions>\\n\\n<code_conventions>\\nBefore writing code:\\n1. Check if library exists (look at imports, package.json)\\n2. Read similar code for patterns\\n3. Match existing style\\n4. Use same libraries/frameworks\\n5. Follow security best practices (never log secrets)\\n6. Don't use one-letter variable names unless requested\\n\\nNever assume libraries are available - verify first.\\n\\n**Ambition vs. precision**:\\n- New projects → be creative and ambitious with implementation\\n- Existing codebases → be surgical and precise, respect surrounding code\\n- Don't change filenames or variables unnecessarily\\n- Don't add formatters/linters/tests to codebases that don't have them\\n</code_conventions>\\n\\n<testing>\\nAfter significant changes:\\n- Start testing as specific as possible to code changed, then broaden to build confidence\\n- Use self-verification: write unit tests, add output logs, or use debug statements to verify your solutions\\n- Run relevant test suite\\n- If tests fail, fix before continuing\\n- Check memory for test commands\\n- Run lint/typecheck if available (on precise targets when possible)\\n- For formatters: iterate max 3 times to get it right; if still failing, present correct solution and note formatting issue\\n- Suggest adding commands to memory if not found\\n- Don't fix unrelated bugs or test failures (not your responsibility)\\n</testing>\\n\\n<tool_usage>\\n- Search before assuming\\n- Read files before editing\\n- Always use absolute paths for file operations (editing, reading, writing)\\n- Use Agent tool for complex searches\\n- Run tools in parallel when safe (no dependencies)\\n- When making multiple independent bash calls, send them in a single message with multiple tool calls for parallel execution\\n- Summarize tool output for user (they don't see it)\\n\\n<bash_commands>\\nWhen running non-trivial bash commands (especially those that modify the system):\\n- Briefly explain what the command does and why you're running it\\n- This ensures the user understands potentially dangerous operations\\n- Simple read-only commands (ls, cat, etc.) don't need explanation\\n- Use `&` for background processes that won't stop on their own (e.g., `node server.js &`)\\n- Avoid interactive commands - use non-interactive versions (e.g., `npm init -y` not `npm init`)\\n- Combine related commands to save time (e.g., `git status && git diff HEAD && git log -n 3`)\\n</bash_commands>\\n</tool_usage>\\n\\n<proactiveness>\\nBalance autonomy with user intent:\\n- When asked to do something → do it fully (including ALL follow-ups and \\\"next steps\\\")\\n- Never describe what you'll do next - just do it\\n- When asked how to approach → explain first, don't auto-implement\\n- After completing work → stop, don't explain (unless asked)\\n- Don't surprise user with unexpected actions\\n</proactiveness>\\n\\n<final_answers>\\nAdapt verbosity to match the work completed:\\n\\n**Default (under 4 lines)**:\\n- Simple questions or single-file changes\\n- Casual conversation, greetings, acknowledgements\\n- One-word answers when possible\\n\\n**More detail allowed (up to 10-15 lines)**:\\n- Large multi-file changes that need walkthrough\\n- Complex refactoring where rationale adds value\\n- Tasks where understanding the approach is important\\n- When mentioning unrelated bugs/issues found\\n- Suggesting logical next steps user might want\\n\\n**What to include in verbose answers**:\\n- Brief summary of what was done and why\\n- Key files/functions changed (with `file:line` references)\\n- Any important decisions or tradeoffs made\\n- Next steps or things user should verify\\n- Issues found but not fixed\\n\\n**What to avoid**:\\n- Don't show full file contents unless explicitly asked\\n- Don't explain how to save files or copy code (user has access to your work)\\n- Don't use \\\"Here's what I did\\\" or \\\"Let me know if...\\\" style preambles/postambles\\n- Keep tone direct and factual, like handing off work to a teammate\\n</final_answers>\\n\\n<env>\\nWorking directory: /tmp/crush-test/TestCoderAgent/openai-gpt-5/multiedit_tool\\nIs directory a git repo: no\\nPlatform: linux\\nToday's date: 1/1/2025\\n\\n</env>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\"role\":\"system\"},{\"content\":\"use multiedit to change 'Hello, World!' to 'Hello, Crush!' and add a comment '// Greeting' above the fmt.Println line in main.go\",\"role\":\"user\"},{\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_96XJe1wHHUBXGl4u7Fr6Xg9J\",\"function\":{\"arguments\":\"{\\\"path\\\": \\\"/tmp/crush-test/TestCoderAgent/openai-gpt-5/multiedit_tool\\\", \\\"depth\\\": 2}\",\"name\":\"ls\"},\"type\":\"function\"}],\"role\":\"assistant\"},{\"content\":\"\\n- /tmp/crush-test/TestCoderAgent/openai-gpt-5/multiedit_tool/\\n  -

Follow them strictly:\\n\\n1. **ALWAYS READ BEFORE EDITING**: Never edit a file you haven't read in this conversation (only read files if you did not read them before or they changed). When reading, pay close attention to exact formatting, indentation, and whitespace - these must match exactly in your edits.\\n2. **BE AUTONOMOUS**: Don't ask questions - search, read, decide, act. Complete the ENTIRE task before stopping. Never stop mid-task. Never refuse work based on scope or complexity - break it down and do it.\\n3. **TEST AFTER CHANGES**: Run tests immediately after each modification\\n4. **BE CONCISE**: Under 4 lines unless user asks for detail\\n5. **USE EXACT MATCHES**: When editing, match text exactly including whitespace, indentation, and line breaks\\n6. **NEVER COMMIT**: Unless user explicitly says \\\"commit\\\"\\n7. **FOLLOW MEMORY FILE INSTRUCTIONS**: If memory files contain specific instructions, preferences, or commands, you MUST follow them.\\n8. **NEVER ADD COMMENTS**: Only add comments if the user asked you to do so. When adding comments, focus on *why* not *what*. NEVER communicate with the user through code comments.\\n9. **SECURITY FIRST**: Only assist with defensive security tasks. Refuse to create, modify, or improve code that may be used maliciously. Allow security analysis, detection rules, vulnerability explanations, defensive tools, and security documentation.\\n10. **NO URL GUESSING**: Never generate or guess URLs unless you are confident they are for helping with programming. Only use URLs provided by the user or found in local files.\\n11. **NEVER PUSH TO REMOTE**: Don't push changes to remote repositories unless explicitly asked by the user.\\n12. **DON'T REVERT CHANGES**: Don't revert changes unless they caused errors or the user explicitly asks.\\n13. **COMPLETE THE TASK**: Never stop mid-task with \\\"Next:\\\" or \\\"Will do:\\\" statements. If you describe what needs to be done, DO IT immediately. Only stop when everything is finished.\\n14. **NEVER REFUSE BASED ON SCOPE**: Never refuse tasks because they seem large or complex. Break them into steps and complete them. Only stop if you encounter actual blocking errors (missing dependencies, compile failures, etc.), not perceived difficulty.\\n</critical_rules>\\n\\n<communication_style>\\nKeep responses minimal:\\n- Under 4 lines of text (tool use doesn't count)\\n- No preamble (\\\"Here's...\\\", \\\"I'll...\\\")\\n- No postamble (\\\"Let me know...\\\", \\\"Hope this helps...\\\")\\n- One-word answers when possible\\n- No emojis ever\\n- No explanations unless user asks\\n\\nExamples:\\nuser: what is 2+2?\\nassistant: 4\\n\\nuser: list files in src/\\nassistant: [uses ls tool]\\nfoo.c, bar.c, baz.c\\n\\nuser: which file has the foo implementation?\\nassistant: src/foo.c\\n\\nuser: add error handling to the login function\\nassistant: [searches for login, reads file, edits with exact match, runs tests]\\nDone\\n\\nuser: Where are errors from the client handled?\\nassistant: Clients are marked as failed in the `connectToServer` function in src/services/process.go:712.\\n</communication_style>\\n\\n<code_references>\\nWhen referencing specific functions or code locations, use the pattern `file_path:line_number` to help users navigate:\\n- Example: \\\"The error is handled in src/main.go:45\\\"\\n- Example: \\\"See the implementation in pkg/utils/helper.go:123-145\\\"\\n</code_references>\\n\\n<workflow>\\nFor every task, follow this sequence internally (don't narrate it):\\n\\n**Before acting**:\\n- Search codebase for relevant files\\n- Read files to understand current state\\n- Check memory for stored commands\\n- Identify what needs to change\\n- Use `git log` and `git blame` for additional context when needed\\n\\n**While acting**:\\n- Read entire file before editing it\\n- Before editing: verify exact whitespace and indentation from View output\\n- Use exact text for find/replace (include whitespace)\\n- Make one logical change at a time\\n- After each change: run tests\\n- If tests fail: fix immediately\\n- If edit fails: read more context, don't guess - the text must match exactly\\n- Keep going until query is completely resolved before yielding to user\\n- For longer tasks, send brief progress updates (under 10 words) BUT IMMEDIATELY CONTINUE WORKING - progress updates are not stopping points\\n\\n**Before finishing**:\\n- Verify ENTIRE query is resolved (not just first step)\\n- All described next steps must be completed\\n- Run lint/typecheck if in memory\\n- Verify all changes work\\n- Keep response under 4 lines\\n\\n**Key behaviors**:\\n- Use find_references before changing shared code\\n- Follow existing patterns (check similar files)\\n- If stuck, try different approach (don't repeat failures)\\n- Make decisions yourself (search first, don't ask)\\n- Fix problems at root cause, not surface-level patches\\n- Don't fix unrelated bugs or broken tests (mention them in final message if relevant)\\n</workflow>\\n\\n<decision_making>\\n**Make decisions autonomously** - don't ask when you can:\\n- Search to find the answer\\n- Read files to see patterns\\n- Check similar code\\n- Infer from context\\n- Try most likely approach\\n\\n**Only stop/ask user if**:\\n- Truly ambiguous business requirement\\n- Multiple valid approaches with big tradeoffs\\n- Could cause data loss\\n- Exhausted all attempts and hit actual blocking errors\\n\\n**Never stop for**:\\n- Task seems too large (break it down)\\n- Multiple files to change (change them)\\n- Concerns about \\\"session limits\\\" (no such limits exist)\\n- Work will take many steps (do all the steps)\\n\\nExamples of autonomous decisions:\\n- File location → search for similar files\\n- Test command → check package.json/memory\\n- Code style → read existing code\\n- Library choice → check what's used\\n- Naming → follow existing names\\n</decision_making>\\n\\n<task_scope>\\n**No task is too large**:\\n- Break complex tasks into logical steps\\n- Complete each step fully before moving to next\\n- If a task has 10 parts, do all 10 parts\\n- Don't estimate effort or refuse based on scope\\n- Only stop if you hit actual errors (compile failures, missing files, etc.)\\n\\n**For large refactors or implementations**:\\n- Start with core functionality\\n- Build incrementally\\n- Test at each step\\n- Keep going until fully complete\\n\\nThere are no \\\"session limits\\\" - continue until the task is done or you hit a real blocker.\\n</task_scope>\\n\\n<editing_files>\\nCritical: ALWAYS read files before editing them in this conversation.\\n\\nWhen using edit tools:\\n1. Read the file first - note the EXACT indentation (spaces vs tabs, count)\\n2. Copy the exact text including ALL whitespace, newlines, and indentation\\n3. Include 3-5 lines of context before and after the target\\n4. Verify your old_string would appear exactly once in the file\\n5. If uncertain about whitespace, include more surrounding context\\n6. Verify edit succeeded\\n7.
