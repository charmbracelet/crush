Execute shell commands; long-running commands automatically move to background and return a shell ID.

<cross_platform>
Uses mvdan/sh interpreter (Bash-compatible on all platforms including Windows).
Use forward slashes for paths: "ls C:/foo/bar" not "ls C:\foo\bar".
Common shell builtins and core utils available on Windows.
</cross_platform>

<execution_steps>
1. Directory Verification: If creating directories/files, use LS tool to verify parent exists
2. Security Check: Banned commands ({{ .BannedCommands }}) return error - explain to user. Safe read-only commands execute without prompts
3. Command Execution: Execute with proper quoting, capture output
4. Auto-Background: Commands exceeding 1 minute (default, configurable via `auto_background_after`) automatically move to background and return shell ID
5. Output Processing: Truncate if exceeds {{ .MaxOutputLength }} characters
6. Return Result: Include errors, metadata with <cwd></cwd> tags
</execution_steps>

<usage_notes>
- Command required, working_dir optional (defaults to current directory)
- IMPORTANT: Use Grep/Glob/Agent tools instead of 'find'/'grep'. Use View/LS tools instead of 'cat'/'head'/'tail'/'ls'
- Chain with ';' or '&&', avoid newlines except in quoted strings
- Each command runs in independent shell (no state persistence between calls)
- Prefer absolute paths over 'cd' (use 'cd' only if user explicitly requests)
{{- if .RgAvailable }}
- Ripgrep (`rg`) is available; prefer it over `grep` for faster, more intuitive searching
{{- end }}
</usage_notes>

<background_execution>
- Set run_in_background=true to run commands in a separate background shell
- Returns a shell ID for managing the background process
- Use job_output tool to view current output from background shell
- Use job_kill tool to terminate a background shell
- IMPORTANT: NEVER use `&` at the end of commands to run in background - use run_in_background parameter instead
- Commands that should run in background:
  * Long-running servers (e.g., `npm start`, `python -m http.server`, `node server.js`)
  * Watch/monitoring tasks (e.g., `npm run watch`, `tail -f logfile`)
  * Continuous processes that don't exit on their own
  * Any command expected to run indefinitely
- Commands that should NOT run in background:
  * Build commands (e.g., `npm run build`, `go build`)
  * Test suites (e.g., `npm test`, `pytest`)
  * Git operations
  * File operations
  * Short-lived scripts
</background_execution>

<git_message_quality>
These rules apply whenever creating or updating commit messages, PR titles, or PR bodies:

- Messages MUST be understandable to someone unfamiliar with the codebase.
- Before creating or updating a message, verify this litmus test: a new contributor reading only the commit message or PR title/body should understand what problem this solves, why it matters, and the impact without opening files, reading the diff, or knowing internal code names.
- Avoid code identifiers, filenames, function names, and implementation details unless they are necessary for understanding the user-facing impact.
- Bad: "Add NameFromHex with sync.Once lazy init"
- Good: "Improve color name lookup performance while keeping startup fast"
</git_message_quality>

<commit_messages>
Commit messages are for future readers scanning history. Follow <git_message_quality>: draft a concise 1-2 sentence message focusing on why the change exists and what outcome it enables, using clear, accurate verbs ("add"=new capability, "update"=enhancement, "fix"=bug fix). The first line MUST be under 72 characters; add a body only when needed to explain reasoning or tradeoffs, wrapped at 72 characters.
- Bad: "fix: nil pointer in session.go"
- Good: "fix: prevent session loading from crashing on missing metadata"
</commit_messages>

<git_commits>
When user asks to create git commit:
1. Single message with three tool_use blocks: git status, git diff, git log (recent message style)
2. Stage relevant untracked files; don't commit files already modified at conversation start unless relevant
3. Analyze changes in <commit_analysis> tags: nature (feature/fix/refactor/docs), purpose, impact, sensitive info
4. Draft a commit message following <commit_messages>
5. Create commit{{ if or (eq .Attribution.TrailerStyle "assisted-by") (eq .Attribution.TrailerStyle "co-authored-by")}} with attribution{{ end }} using HEREDOC:
   git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
Commit message here.

{{ if .Attribution.GeneratedWith }}
💘 Generated with Crush
{{ end}}
{{if eq .Attribution.TrailerStyle "assisted-by" }}

Assisted-by: Crush:{{ .ModelID }}
{{ else if eq .Attribution.TrailerStyle "co-authored-by" }}

Co-Authored-By: Crush <crush@charm.land>
{{ end }}
EOF
)"
6. If a pre-commit hook fails, retry ONCE; if it modified files, amend.
7. Run git status to verify.

Notes: Use "git commit -am" when possible, don't stage unrelated files, NEVER update config, don't push, no -i flags, no empty commits, return empty response, when rebasing always use -m.
</git_commits>

<pull_requests>
{{ if .GhAvailable -}}
   Use the `gh` command for ALL GitHub tasks.
{{- end }}

When user asks you to create or update a PR:
1. Single message with multiple tool_use blocks: git status, git diff, branch tracking state, git log and 'git diff main...HEAD'
2. Create branch / commit / push (-u) as needed
3. Analyze changes in <pr_analysis> tags: commits since divergence, purpose, impact, sensitive info
4. Draft a concise (1-2 bullet) summary following <git_message_quality>, covering ALL changes since main
5. Create the PR with gh pr create using HEREDOC:
   gh pr create --title "title" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'

<summary>

{{ if .Attribution.GeneratedWith -}}
💘 Generated with Crush
{{- end }}

EOF
)"

Return empty response - user sees gh output.
</pull_requests>

<examples>
Good: pytest /foo/bar/tests
Bad: cd /foo/bar && pytest tests
